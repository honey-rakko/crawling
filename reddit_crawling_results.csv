"Creating Amazing Games on a Budget, or want to Learn how? Try These!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/jaa4bg/creating_amazing_games_on_a_budget_or_want_to/,"Hey everyone! Game Developer Here! I've worked in games from across the financial spectrum; In a studio with some of the most expensive and high end software available, and on my own in my front porch using only what I have in my pocket. Today I want to share with you what I wish I knew, which is all of the best, cost effective options for making your own game.

FYI: I'm not just ranking Free/Cheapest software, I'm ranking the best value stuff. It's easy to go 100% free, but your game will die on its arse if you burden yourself with learning all the most complex free open source software, this list will show you what to use to make your game **Cheaply**, **Quickly,** and **Well!**

# 3D

**Blender (3D Modelling, Sculpting, Rendering, Animtion) - Free**

*In my Opinion, Blender is the greatest tool to any Indie Dev. Not just because it's free and open source, but because it is genuinely amazing software, it can do so much nowadays. It has always been my go to, even when given the option of higher end more expensive software.*

**Quixel (3D Texturing, Material Creation) - Free**

*Another Free option for 3D, Quixel. You'll be able to produce high quality Materials and Texture for your 3D assets, and even though Quixel specialises in realism, it's a diverse tool that can yield great stylised assets.*

# 2D

**GIMP (2D Image Editing Software) - Free**

*It has come a long way, GIMP is a great image editor, and will aid you well when creating 2D elements for your game. It has everything you'll need to make those elements quickly.*

# Video

**Resolve (Video Editing Software) - Free**

*This is my favourite bit of free software since Blender. It is incredibly good, easy to learn, and powerful tool. I already prefer it to the Adobe counterparts. If you're gonna make a game you will want to be making Trailers, Dev Blogs, and Maybe Cutscenes, and this is the kit you'll want to use to to it.*

**OBS (Screen Capture Spftware) - Free**

*Thank god the Age of Fraps is over (Remember Fraps?) OBS is a phenomenal gift to our industry, it is quick and easy to use and works incredibly well. Set it up and use it to capture that Trailer Footage and Dev Log!*

# Audio

**Audacity (Sound Effect Editing) - Free**

*A crucial little bit of software for any indie Dev, It's all you'll need to edit your sounds. Although rudimentary it gets the job done and is exceptionally easy to use.*

[**FreeSound.org**](https://FreeSound.org) (**Audio Resource Platform) - Free** (Credit Sometimes)

*Does what it says on the tin, a huge online portfolio of community contributed sounds. However, make sure you check which licence each sound has! Some are creative commons, but others require credit and maybe even royalties. Keep in mind that FreeSound is a mixed bag. Try to learn some sound design principles first, you don't want your game full of popping, clicking, peaking SFX.*

[**Zapsplat.com**](https://Zapsplat.com) (**Audio Resource Platform) -** Free / (Gold: £4 Monthly / £30 Yearly)

*Okay, so it's not free (But Bare with me here). If you have to pay for anything when making your game, pay for a Zapsplat Subscription. The Sounds on this platform are phenomenal and you get access to them all with a Gold membership (Which is only £4 monthly and £30 Yearly!) It's so worth it, because the Gold tier sounds are Hollywood tier, and you will save SO much time on editing, because these will always be top quality, and will make your game sound AMAZING.*

**Music Maker (Music Mixing Package \[DAW\]) -** (Free for Software) + (£15 Monthly for  ∞ Loops)

\*If Royalty/Copyright Free music isn't doing it for you and you want entry level software to get you quickly making music, try this out! It is technically free, but unless you know how to write, record, and create music You'll need a leg up with some Loops. Which is where ""\*∞ Loops"" comes in handy. They will give you a ridiculous amount of Loops to use for £15 monthly, and trust me, that is bloody cheap! Then you can inconsequentially mix music on the cheap, on the fly, and very very quickly. (It's also super fun)

*Intermission: Loops are selections of prerecorded music (usually one instrument) that you can combine to quickly create your own music without actually needing to know how to play any instruments or create melodies. You can just figure out what sounds good, and combine stuff that feels right for your game. Music Maker is also possibly the most beginner friendly software on this list.*

# Admin

**Google Drive (Word Processing, Presenting, Spreadsheets, Surveys...) - Free**

*I'm sure you've used these all to death by now, but it doesn't change how versatile and helpful they are. They are the groundwork to any and all project planning, and it's even better when you need to share it with team members in real time! (If you have team members that is) Also USE FORMS! They are amazing for getting feedback from your game. Make it easy for users to give you feedback and forms in perfect for that.*

**Trello (Task Management) - Free**

*Another simple but ultimately crucial necessity when making a game, even if you are solo, there is no contender for Trello's checklists, they are simple, easy to use, visual, and help you manage your time.*

# Engines

**Unity - (Game Engine) - Free**

*I hugely appreciate Unity for its clear and clean workspace. It's great at showing you all sides of a game engine. But be prepared to learn a few heavy subjects along the way. Unity will not hold your hand, which is a good thing, because it means the workspace is easy to follow and neat, if you want any fancy tools, be prepared to make it happen. But you should start simple and small. Don't make your dream game just yet. Make something that you think is insultingly simple, then work your way up.*

**UE4 - (Game Engine) - Free**

*Even though these two are somewhat counterparts, they couldn't be more different. UE4 is a powerful high end bit of kit. Its huge slew of heavy built in tools are there to help you make ridiculously good looking/feeling/playing games without you having to be some sort of computer Wizard. As a result of this, it harbours an interface with many many layers, if game engines are new to you, this will be daunting. But something UE4 Does amazingly, is teaching you how to push your game as far as it will go.*

\-

The way I see it, Unity is the best for showing you how a game engine works, and Unreal is great at showing you what a game engine can do. If you wanna try em both, start with Unity, and once you know the Lingo and ins and outs, try out a few specific things in UE4. Your choice will largely fall under preference and what kind of games you want to make.

# Bonus Top Tips!

1. Making your first ever game? Plan your game meticulously, get the dates down to a T, really visualise your project... now... multiply that by 10... I'm not bloody joking. I'm pretty experienced at this point, I've worked on many games, and I still multiply my first scale by at least 5.
2. When should you spend money? If you're diving into a skill that is new to you and definitely not aligned with your strengths. Spend some cash to make it easier. For me that is Music and Audio, I could have easily wasted 50% of my game's Dev time learning these skills properly from the ground up. And if you're wasting time, you're not truly saving money. If spending £50 means your music creation time scale goes from 5 months, down to 2 weeks. Do it! For the love of god do it!
3. Start simpler than you think you want. Its very easy for a game to become more complex while you work (and trust me, it will) but it's very very hard to simplify a fundamentally complex game.
4. Tutorials are a great way to START learning, but not a great way to KEEP learning. Try to be flexible with what you learn as much as possible. Truth is, most Youtube tutorials are really really bad and will have you picking up terrible habits (Literally anyone can make a popular tutorial despite how inexperienced they are). I have seen many games fail because their foundations were built on terrible Youtube tutorials.
5. Another Tutorial one! If the person you are watching is not explaining to you how your thing works or what it is doing, STOP watching them. You don't need your game full of crap only one person on the planet understands. If they aren't helping you understand your own game, you are not going to know how to fix things, improve things, or progress.
6. Lastly make sure you have FUN! You're game will be better if you genuinely enjoy the process. Don't make a game you think will just be incredible but feel crap the whole time you are making it, enjoy the process! Focus on sides of the game that you enjoy. If you Love Love Love level design, simplify your mechanics, have a dead simple art style, grab copyright free music and sounds, and spend your time having fun designing wicked levels. It WILL show. People are much more likely to remember your game for its amazing levels filled with passion.

Anyway, that's all I have today. I Wish someone had told me any of these during my first few years of game Dev, but at least I can pass it on to. Best of Luck!","Thank you very much !

On the tutorial part I'd like to add : begin with a course, it will give you very solid bases. From here, you'll easily see what's crap and what's good in YouTube tutorials.

I strongly recommend the courses made by gamedev.tv, they cover unity, unreal and blender. Count about 100$ for a course, but you can get them at ~20$ on udemy every flash sell.
Thanks! This was very helpful
This was super helpful thank you"
Are videogame songs copyrighted?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/1hwh1r4/are_videogame_songs_copyrighted/,"Ive recently gotten into making some youtube videos and most of my humor is from the usage of sound effects and editing.

But when it comes to background music Im at a loss, I dont quite know how copyright works. Sure, I am not at a level yet where I make anything on Youtube and therefore I dont have to worry about copyright *yet.* But I hope to make a living of Youtube some day.

My question is, are videogame soundtracks, like Cuphead, Payday, Plants vs Zombies copyrighted music? Or can I use that in the background? Given the fact that people play the game and make money of videos about that game with the songs in the background it should be safe to use? or am I wrong?

Edit: It seems like what I am learning now is that copyright is what makes a lot of creators stay small, unless you can cough up money, youre screwed.","Yes.

> Or can I use that in the background? 

You *probably shouldn't,* however game developers tend not to add their soundtracks to ContentID and other detection services as they want people creating content about *their* games. That's why it's fairly common to see streamers and other content creators using VGM as background music - they can *get away* with it.

However it would not typically be 'Fair Use' to simply use the music as background music, *even if your video is about the game that the music is from.* If the rights holder takes exception to your usage they would be within their rights to issue a copyright takedown notice.

'Lets play' videos *may* be considered 'fair use' in which case the music playing as part of the game itself would also *likely* be considered fair use.

But 'Fair Use' is a *legal defence* - not a protection. It only comes into play if you are on the recieving end of legal action and need to defend yourself, in which case you have to prove to a court that your usage of the copyrighted material counts as 'fair use.'

This video is an excellent crash course on copyright in the context of content creation:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jwo5qc78QU
Yes. Yes they are.
Copyright isn't something you do.  You own copyright from the moment you create the music.

The issue with copyright from a physical perspective is that should the time arise that you need to prove you own copyright in a legal battle, you need to be able to convince a judge you own that copyright.

There are a number of things you can do to help you convince a judge.  One thing that used to be common as a little extra was to mail yourself your music with a dated recorded delivery and never open it, so you could take a dated, sealed package to court.  You can upload to royalty companies like PPL and PRS, or your countries equivalent.  Any number of things you can combine as evidence.

So yeah, it isn't some magic piece of copyright  legal paper.  You own copyright the moment you create that sheet music, or song in your DAW, or post it note with lyrics on.  You create it, you own the copyright.

A lot of it comes down to does the person, or company whose copyright you infringed give enough of a shit about it to do something about it.  That is completely open to each individuals choice.  

Youtube is a prime example.  Some people will happily let you upload and claim royalties from your video, others will outright block your video and your upload will result in an immediate message to your email saying your upload has been blocked on copyright grounds.
Most probably so, unless they are 100 years old. I dont recommend messing with any resources from commercial product without professional law support.
Videogame songs are copyrighted, however many games (especially indies) use royalty free tracks that are either free or can be licensed for a small fee, if you can find them (often in the credits).



For example KSP and [Incompetech](https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html)
Depends on the game but usually yes. But most devs will allow a game video to use game’s music
yes
Bill Clinton signed a law in the 90s that makes anything created automatically gets copyright protection.
what about other soundtracks such as Sonic the hedgehog soundtracks or Mario sound tracks, sample songs:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=nrYuD\_U9ihk&t=100s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=nrYuD_U9ihk&t=100s)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha3LVmEwrfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha3LVmEwrfs)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETLNilxpvhY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETLNilxpvhY)

idk how copyright works but I see other youtubers use these soundtracks but I'm not  quite sure. plez help i just want to know the rules of copywrite and as well as can i use the  songs above. thx
Copyright exists on pretty much everything. The difference is that game studios have a contract with their composers to license their music (often permanently and exclusively, but not always).

Copyright doesn't mean you can't use something, it just means you need a license.
Yes, the music is copyrighted, but it's a lot safer to try and *get away with* than regular music. For example, I make NHL 24/25 videos from time to time and I use the music from NHL 99 through NHL 2002 because it's not registered with YouTube's ID system. Never had an issue.
I wanted to reply on your Edit comment.  
There's plenty of cheap, copyright free (or, you get a license to use the music) music. The harder part is finding something that fits. But with these vast libraries today, it really isn't that bad.

There are plenty of big YouTubers who use the same music, or sound effect, over and over, because that's what they bought once they were small, and it still works for them.

So some of the major downsides are finding music that fits and that people know:

Normally, I have a song in my head that would fit and want to use that, but it is copyrighted. Finding music that evokes the some emotion takes a lot more time, than knowing the song you want to use.

The 2nd downside is that copyrighted music, or music from games, is known and will evoke memories with the viewers. Play a song from the Beatles, and you not only have a song, but also the nostalgia of the 60's and everything that goes with it. That is often hard to get with a song from those libraries.

Still, I think it's only a small hindrance. You should be able to create your content and find music that supports what you want to share. Prices can be very low. $2 sometimes for a song. Or $20. Sometimes even free.  
Here is a list of libraries I've found:  
**Free Audio**

[Tunetank.com](http://Tunetank.com)

[Upbeat.io](http://Upbeat.io)

[Mixkit.co](http://Mixkit.co) 

[Bensound.com](http://Bensound.com)

[Ncs.io](http://Ncs.io)

[YouTube.com/audiolibrary](http://YouTube.com/audiolibrary) 

[https://sfxengine.com](https://sfxengine.com)

[Freesound.org](http://Freesound.org)

The wiki for r/videoediting also has a list of copyright free music:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/wiki/faq/resources/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/wiki/faq/resources/)

FYI, these websites offer music where you also get a license, or the rights, to use them in your video. That doesn't mean they are free. Some actually also offer free music. Like youtube's audio library.

Lastly, if you have a track you like, you could try to find a composer, that can recreate the song for you, but specifically for you. Check Fiverr for cheap labour (often from people in countries where the wages are lower). This is actually how it is done for many Hollywood movies. They use actual songs for the ""Temp-track"" and then ask a composer to recreate the music in a new way. That way the music is all in the same style of the movie, and they don't have to pay absurd amounts of money to use a song. Here's a small part from a podcast that talks about temp scores. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49TqnDtfP6Y&t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49TqnDtfP6Y&t=5s)

one more thing, I'm not sure if that's the same everywhere. But you have the song itself and you have the performance. Please be aware that both are protected. Finding the sheet music for a popular song and letting friends play won't work. You still have to pay for the rights of the sheet music (the idea of the song). Then you have the performance. E.g. if I would ask Katy Perry to sing a song from Lady Gaga, I have to pay both of them. One for the song, the other for the performance.   
  
All those libraries I mentioned with copyright free music, you get both. Both the performance and the ""song"".
hi. i edit youtube videos for a living. you are good to use video game music. just be very careful with nintendo music, they tend to pick and choose. mario stuff and fgc stuff is good for sure. never had an issue in all my years of doing this full time. it’s pretty standard. if your worries, upload unlisted and wait for the checks to complete. it will tell you any copyright issues.
Yes
I used Elden Ring BG music ,  none are copyrighted  thank you so much Mr Myazaki 🩵"
which youtubers to use for video gaming portfolio,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/1foe5je/which_youtubers_to_use_for_video_gaming_portfolio/,"hi guys, aspiring editor here. when it comes to editing footage of video game gameplay, i'm curious about etiquette or copyright infringement. is it fine to use other people's raw gaming footage to make videos for your portfolio (if you state the footage isn't yours of course) ? should i get the youtuber/streamer's permission ? are there any youtubers/streamers who stated in the past that they were fine with their footage being used for portfolio work ?

  
i've read on the subreddit before that it's always better to shoot your own content, but it feels kind of weird for video gaming compilations. 

  
apologies if this sounds really dumb, i have no experience with portfolio building and would rather ask than possibly do something rude/stupid. ","If you really want to use others raw footage you can try vtubers. Their community actively promotes people making things like clips of their content. Other than that, it's kind of a tricky situation as it greatly differs from person to person and most probably wouldn't respond to any inquiries you'd make. You could try recording a gaming session with friends and using that, too.
People do this all the time when starting their careers in graphic design so I imagine it’s fine here as well. It’s called spec work and it’s completely fine to put in your portfolio when you don’t have enough “official” work yet. Just make sure it’s apparent that it wasn’t done in collaboration with the creator.
If you’re starting a portfolio, aim high. Video game playthrough footage is low level hobby junk.

If you have to do game edits, build a portfolio with you doing reviews of games. Commentary on game design. Much more thought and effort go into reviews, rather than just editing highlights.  And that will make your stuff more appealing.
As long as it's just for sharing with prospective clients and not posted publicly on your website, there's no problem with that. Not sure if it will be an effective demo reel though.
It's completely fine and you won't get any copyright unless you are posting it on YouTube (which I am sure you are not doing)

If you are doing it for portfolio, go for it. If for a client, I would suggest you to edit him a sample of a gaming video that he send you.
This is actually really great because I came to this sub to ask nearly the same question, but directed at podcasts (though I had thought about reaching out to some known game streamers). I'm just getting into FCPX and it's got me really excited to dive in - even though I've got no formal training and don't know squat about ""official"" video editing techniques or technical knowledge.

I figured I would reach out to some smaller streamers that may be more responsive to contact and proposing some trail projects. idk
depending on what you're looking for, i can offer up my footage. 
i have some higher level no HUD wukong footage im working on a full playthrough to make a cut edit for, with split facecam and game recorded separate. 1440p60 high quality

The only thing i ask is you share the edit with me after and if it's good enough that i can use it as well.

feel free to dm me about it
If someone doesn't add anything to the raw gameplay like live commentary, voiceover, editing, etc. then it is pretty fine to take and use (though it is nice to ask).

There are a lot of channels that just upload 6 hour videos of them playing a game with no cuts or anything. Try reaching out to some of them."

I would be charging AT LEAST $2000/month for this.
Seriously makes me so upset seeing stuff like this. I see it all the time on Upwork. People undervaluing editors drives me up a wall.
Lmao what the fuck, looking through I was like this is all sounding very good and to the point, man the last line hit like a truck lmfao
Outrageous salary aside, is it even possible to edit 3 youtube videos of 10 minutes each per week with dynamic editing, sound design etc as said in the post?

As a new professionnal editor without a lot of experience i’m sometimes wondering if i’m too slow while editing, one video like that would take me 2 weeks
That was a real “wait for it…” read. You can hear the rate going down for every additional thing they required of you
Is this Upwork? I can swear that I saw this like a month ago, no surprise no one applied lol.
$20 per video? 😂 

Guess they're looking for somebody in a developing country.
Do 1 vid for them and have those pop-in zoom cuts every 20 seconds so by the end its just 50 pixels visible.
LMFAO! I had to do a double take to ensure I wasn't missing any zeros. Some people's children....
Haha I see these bs job offers in up work all the time, these people are absolutely mental
This kind of request should be made public and ridiculed into either shrinking away or getting their act straight. This kind of BS needs to be eradicated.
Actually you know what? What if they're seeing who takes the bait then they'll go Mr Beast on you and shower you with $20k
20$ for a video?  


I don't even get out of bed for less than 150, and even that is for only simple stuff
And the videos are probably top 10's with no footage, just an ugly script and short deadlines (yeah this was my first freelancing job)
I cannot believe someone would have the effrontery to come up with, and then put out a 'job posting' like that.

Ridiculous, disrespectful and demeaning.
There are so many red flags it’s insane. I feel sorry for anyone desperate for work that would even entertain applying. It’s written by someone who has no fucking clue about post production and I’ll guarantee that whomever they hire will get fired if the views are low.
LMFAO! I had to do a double take to ensure I wasn't missing any zeros. Some people's children....
That's the most loaded $20 I've ever seen LOL

They said you have to be a funny person. Ask about the missing 0s in the offer and laugh at their ""typo""
>Adobe Premiere Pro and Davinci Resolve are the only professional video editing programs. such is Final Cut Pro

""NO ONE WANTS TO WORK!"" -these people probably.
You couldn't get anyone to watch 3 video a week for that much money.
Haha wtf the nerve on these people.

Bet you this is one guy who thinks he found a way to have 100 channels run in parallel for free. 

20 will pay for the other 80.

Business time
Man I wish I could say something to these people. I pray no editor even considers apply for this, what an insulting post.
The sad part is that they will likely be making hundreds of thousands of dollars on these video creations (if they're a true content farm and know what they're doing).  But, they wouldn't be making an offer like that if there weren't people out there who would bite.  

I wouldn't even bother responding to them, since this isn't anything personal (they're sending that same message to anyone and everything) and responding to it is just more time wasted with them that you're not getting paid for.

I wish this were funny... but over the past 30+ years in the industry I've seen this kind of offer more times than I can remember (obviously YouTube wasn't around back then, but television stations were the worst at trying to hire someone to run around shooting commercials for their advertising clients and paying the camera/operator/editor next to nothing -- or nothing if it were an internship -- in addition to many other people/companies trying to take advantage of people in every way imaginable.  Seriously -- there is a YouTube channel ready-to-be-made in exposing and talking about this kind of swindle).

Thanks for the laugh.  :)
If anyone has ever worked in the esport industry or streaming culture industry, 20 dollars is a lot to them. They are so fucking delusional.
I read in some other sub that these kinds of posts can be reported to the different sites as fake, so there is something we can do about these. Pay rate doesn't match responsibilities may be one of the options.
Worst part is that most likely they’ll find someone to get the job done for that budget"

I did read wiki, however I can't find any clues there. It's worth noting that video was recorded and remuxed with OBS before editing it, everything was done on single laptop. I only cut ending in it with Premiere Pro and edited audiotrack with Adobe Audition. Now I'm thinking that I should've just used ffmpeg to merge new audiotrack with original videotrack after cutting it with, again, ffmpeg.

FFmpeg did the trick. I got even smaller video (366 MB) with seemingly original quality.

Copyright free music: does this count as a remix?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/1ff8suf/copyright_free_music_does_this_count_as_a_remix/,"Hello everyone! I'm not a video editor -not even an amateur one- but I had to start editing for work some months ago and I've not fully understood how everything works. 

I always download royalty free music from websites like Pixabay, Upbeat, Pond 5 and their rules often state that I can't use the track for remixes. The problem is that -since the tracks are often longer than the videos I edit- I usually cut out the middle part of the track and match the end of the part I keep with the end of the actual track. I do this just because i **hate** when videos end with the audio track just fading out, it sounds like I didn't put any effort in edit the video, so I like to have an actual closure for the audio track.

My question is: would this count as a remix? Could it be a reason for future issues with the owner of the song?

*You'll probably be thinking ""why don't you just look for shorter tracks?"" and the answer is: because it's hard to find good free music with a duration from 0:30-1:00*

  
Thank you!","That's fine.

FYI, the music in question is copyrighted, but it is allowed to be used ""royalty free."""
Stuck between DaVinci Canva Capcut ,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/1dizqlo/stuck_between_davinci_canva_capcut/,"I am far from a Pro video editor and doing a lecture series for sheer passion. However, I want to maintain minimum acceptable quality for YT.

My needs were a mix bag of everything basic:

1. Shape animation (blocks and squares and arrows)
2. Some part shooting shooting (speaking)
3. Stock Images + videos
4. No out of the world color/particle effects

I began with Capcut but it did not give me the desired quality assets. It's a bit confusing what is free vs copyrighted asset. But I maybe wrong, if someone has a smooth (no copyright/watermark issues) experience with basic stuff I need with Capcut.

Then I tried DaVinci Free version but learning curve is quite steep. It's good for 4K export etc tasks but not for the simple shape animations I wanted flawlessly.

Then I got Canva which gives me all of the above. However, while putting in a 4K footage, I hit the roadblock: 1GB file limit (for my typical video size, footage will be easily 3 GB with 4K)

I have split my footage files and done every other trick to make it fit, and made it work. But it is far from smooth, and I have to do a lot of post-editing past importing into Canva. The editor is inflexible in operations like trimming etc. The limitations w.r.t. page duration, file size make it extremely difficult to work with.

I am open to any workarounds, or alternate suggestions.

Thanks in advance!","Are you on Mac? If so, sounds like FCP with FxFactory's [Shapes plugin](https://fxfactory.com/info/shapes/) exactly fits your bill. I do shape animations a lot and Shapes and [AddMotion](https://fxfactory.com/info/osmaddmotion/) make it extremely easy. No keyframing is needed to create really complex shape animations right inside the FCP timeline.
Sounds like you should try FCP."

Epidemic Sound and/or Artlist... both are 10 bucks a month for the basic license which allows monetization for 1 youtube channel.
Or you could ask a composer (like me) to get you what you need and deal with him composing prestation and rights allowance. A great way to distinguish your work imo, it can give your videos a unique style that could fit your vision.

But hey, generic composed hip hop/trap/drill tracks are so much cheaper ;)
Soundstripe is really good for the price. It’s 10$/month for unlimited downloads of music and they have a lot of new stuff added regularly. We have a few different services, but they’re hard to beat for the price and offer.

I'd like to know where to find videos for my music.

You could hire a composer to score your work! I work in this field and would be happy to take on the job or even offer you my own library of music to choose from for $10 a month. Not as many people will be using my stuff as opposed to a bigger company offering the same thing and it will give your video a more distinct sound

usually when i am in need of music and think about my favourite games/ movies/ TV shows soundtracks. I find it puts a bit more of MY personality in the work while also making it something i think is good and not something i think others might think is good
I heard Epidemic Sounds is rly good
youtube audio library and freesound.org
I just choose tracks from Kevin MacLeod that I like on YouTube, nothing special.
I suggest thematic!
I have a similar question I'm wondering if the default background music you find in a lot of video editing apps is royalty free. The apps I most often use are the default Samsung Video Editor and Inshot. But I also use Clipchamp and all of these have music but they don't all tell you anything about where the music cones from. So I'm wondering... Can I assune that if the music is there then it's free to use unless it specifies otherwise?
Youtube beats are a good one. Normally you listen to them for free and if you like them then you can buy the lease. Beats by Leo is a good one, the first one that popped on my mind for the 90's-early 2000's rap music vibe. Here's his link: [www.youtube.com/@isaacleobeats](https://www.youtube.com/@isaacleobeats)

How can I use music from popular bands and celebrities in my videos?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/xmuwzq/how_can_i_use_music_from_popular_bands_and/,"By this I mean for my personal YouTube - videos will be monetized and I want to buy the license to these tracks. However popular sound-design sites like epidemic sound etc. don't have songs by bands and artists.

For context - If I wanted to use an ac/dc song what is the way to get a copyright licensee for that? Any help from someone more knowledgeable on this would really help.

**Edit:** Dam I did not know popular music licenses were this expensive lol, I get licensed music off of epidemic and did not think the gap would be this exponential. For reference my research has made me find that thunderstruck license for a signal movie and that too for a few minutes was around half a million.","So you would need to find the copyright holder and contact them for a license. Depending on what type license you would need, this is often times pricey and out of reach for most content creators. 

The only service i know of for more popular music that has gained some real traction to help get creators more popular music is www.lickd.co , they have a wide variety of well known music that they license.  I know many YouTubers that have a perceived production value increase by using their service as their songs are often popular and current.  

Songfacts.com also has great information on the types of licensing you would need, and resources to find information.  Here is some information from their site on license types so if you are contacting a copyright holder you know what type of license to ask for etc:

""Master Use License: This gives you the right to use the song for TV, film, commercials and other audio-video projects.

												

Synchronization License: Also called a ""Sync Licence,"" this gives you the right to edit the song into a production of some kind, thus ""synching"" it to the video. You would need this for a commercial or music video, for example, in addition to the Master Use License.

												

Mechanical License: This is what you'll need if you want to release a cover version of a song or sample/interpolate it.

Print License: If you're writing a book and want to include lyrics, you're going to need a Print License.

Grand Performance License: This type of license grants you the right to use a piece of music in a play, musical or any other similar performance.""
A) I've read AC/DC is in particularly very costly. I don't know this is a fact, but I've seen the claim, so be warned.

B) Ideally this isn't a case where the song is required. I'd shoot/edit the video first, or at least as much of it as you can. If shooting it is pointless without the song, then sure, license it first but realize you're spending money, so this is a true endeavor.

C) Let's do it.

Step 1: There are sites for this! Some are the publishers sites themselves, and it's relatively easy! Others are third parties that deal with this for you. (And some publishers farm out their licensing to third parties to handle!) They'll charge a small but extra bit it's probably worth the headache, and you might not have an option. Just search ""license a song for YouTube"" and you'll see options.

Step 2: Don't see the song you want? Go here, ASCAP's Repertory, and search ACE: https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/

Find the song you want, find what publisher owns the version of the song you want, and contact their licensing department/rep. That just takes a bunch of Googling. (Last time I looked for something it was owned by a tiny label which was owned by a larger label which was eventually bought by Warner Chapel. The small company's site and Wikipedia were my friend that day.) Done line Universal will have full sites that make it easy. Sometimes it gets odd and you can send a polite, SHORT, and respectful email to an actual person.

""Hi, I'm Jeff. I'm an amateur filmmaker and I'm looking to licence the song X, by Y. That is owned by Z, which I believe you are the parent company of. This is for a YouTube video project I wish to monetize. Could you please point me in the right direction for finding out more about licensing this?

Thank you for you time.""

This is business, so approach them as a respectful customer. No begging or apologizing needed, but don't go all in like you're owed anything. Just be cool.

And make sure to clearly ask that they're offering the license you need to use this on YouTube. Be direct and ask. ""So I can use this on YouTube with no legal issue with only your approval?""

Step 3: PROFIT!

D) I hope the song by the artist you're looking for is available and cheap!
Unless you've got a ridiculously massive budget you won't be using any bands you've heard on the radio in your videos or films. The days of cheap music licensing left when digital music (easy piracy)  began.
You won’t want to afford the music even if you have money to spend. It’s not cheap.
Matt Johnson has a video about this. [Matt Johnson YouTube](https://youtu.be/0cnk6s2y0mY)
You can use it... but expect it the video to be demonetized or revenue diverted at best, removed at worse.
You could make a cover of it. Midi version...edit the multi tracks
Lickd.co costs me about €7-10 per song
Have to not a toll
This is a question which has perplexed me for years.

Sometimes, playing the riff, or chords of a song, but not mentioning the title of the song or name of the band seems to work (e.g., some of Ric Beato's videos); while at other times, just changing the mix of the song slightly seems to work (e.g., some of Ably House's Beatles guitar instructional videos).

But then, you hear of other people who cannot do things the way those two Ably House and Beato do....so, I am flumoxed.
In addition to ASCAP, see [BMI](BMI.com).
While you likely won't have the budget for the song as performed by AC/DC, I would look into finding a cover of the song and getting permission for that. YouTube often lets cover versions of songs split revenue between the video creator and the song owners
Ok so YouTube dings you for including it in an edited video but what about the videos on TikTok and using those songs there? 

Very popular, synced (sync license?) and edited into 3 min and up to 10 min videos on some accounts! How can TikTok do that? 

Can we make edited videos and upload them to TikTok directly or do we have to use the TikTok video editor to add the music?"

I was gonna do this, did a bunch of research and decided the latter was a much safer route. Much finer line between those two scenarios.

What are the options if you want to upload your own video to youtube and there is one song that you really want to use in your video?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/z541wq/what_are_the_options_if_you_want_to_upload_your/,"I just started looking into video editing and one thing that I find rather annoying is dealing with music. Obviously you can not use whatever you want and I get it. Eventhough there is quite a bit of music availabe online that you can use ""for free"" I personally find it very stressful to go through different libraries and find a song that kind of fits for what you are going for. Especially because sometimes I already have songs in mind (from my spotify library or whatever) that fit perfectly and there just wont be another song that will satisfy me. But again you can not just pick whatever song and use it in your video

So 2 questions

1. What would you have to do if you had one song that you really wanted to use in your video legally? And that is not available on whatever site ""for free"" or ""without copyright"" (or whatever term, not sure if there is a difference)
2.  If I would cover the song with e.g. a piano or guitar (no vocals) could I use that in my video? Are there limits to this? If I cover a song that already is a ""piano song"" it would sound pretty identical. Would this be possible?","You are free to cover the song and use that, the automatic copyright strikes are against using the recording, not the written musical content.

You would however need to deal with licencing the rights from the writer. There are services through which you can do this, I know Distrokid lets you record and release covers and deals with the licencing, I'm sure other services exist.

If your video isn't monetised and if you're not using anyone else's recording though then practically speaking I expect you'll be fine. If you want to monetise it though I'd look for a distributor to take care of the licencing up front.
the only reason you should be worried about this is if you’re looking to monetize the video. if not, you will simply get a copyright claim (NOT A STRIKE) on your video. which means ads will likely be placed on it and any revenue will go to the copyright holder.
Just a note: If you ever plan on editing professionally, you'll have to get used to looking through royalty-free libraries. I've spent countless hours doing so, it's just part of the job. There are some good inexpensive subscriptions you can get that allow you full use of their libraries, like Envato Elements. There's definitely some good stuff on there, and you can legally do pretty much whatever you want with it.
Automated Content ID is tuned to go after reproductions of the original recordings, so, unless your cover sounds really close to the original, it probably won't get flagged. One thing you can try is creating a throwaway account where you want to upload, render out a video with the song in and upload it, and see if it gets flagged.

With that said, to do it completely legally, what you're looking for is a Sync License. You would need one of these no matter if it's the original or a cover, as it would protect your use of the musical composition and and the original recording within your video. Whether you need to get one or not depends on what the video's purpose is for. If it's a short/movie meant for festival screening or distribution, you absolutely need a license, for example. For a YouTube video, you can try the method above, or compose/commission someone to make you a soundalike, a piece of music that has similar sonic elements than the one you want, but is enough of an original composition to not fall under copyright. This is what a lot of ad agencies do to reference copyrighted music.

You can use services lice EasySong to get the license you need for your project https://support.easysong.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039408054-Music-Licensing-for-Streaming
YouTube content ID can often either

* monetise the video for the audio rights holder

* make the video be ""unavailable"" in certain regions or world wide

It only takes a short time for the automatic systems to make the detection and the decision.  You can have the video set to private through out this time.

So uploading some footage accompanying the desired audio should give you some answers in fairly short time (say, 15 mins)
Sync licensing - and depending on the company that owns it, it can take weeks to months to process the request. Learned the hard way to ask clients during pre prod if there’s a song in mind
I think Vimeo is way more lax about allowing songs so long as your video is not monetized in any way. That's been my experience anyway.
If you’re not making money use whatever you want
Just use it if you’re not planning on monetising your video, I do it all the time no worries.
Just pay for the sync license of the song just like any other video maker
You can put copyrighted music in your videos no problem. You just won’t collect revenue on those videos; the revenue will go to the copyright holder.

You won’t get copyright strikes unless you are distributing entire copyrighted works (TV shows, movies) wholesale."

I've been collecting for a few years. I purchase someone Humble ... Bundle and Fanatical every now and again for dirt cheap but there are LEGAL FREE sources of sfx you can get as well.

Here are a few free sources (read the licenses)

[https://sfxcellar.accusonus.com/free-sound-effects](https://sfxcellar.accusonus.com/free-sound-effects)

The motherload of free SFX.

[https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc](https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc)

They release a MASSIVE free pack every years for GameDevelopes Confrence from their library and the files are free to use, no stringgs attached.

To manage your library, I 'd recommend using ADSR Sample Manager.
[https://freesound.org/](https://freesound.org/) 

Is where I go first for sound clips, some want a mention some don't.

As for YouTube, this is what the YouTube license says:

YouTube Audio Library License

YouTube may credit the artist and link the Audio Library from your video.

Hey,
I got this brand new [YouTube channel with free sound effects](https://youtube.com/@sefe_soundeffectsforedits). In the description of each video I leave a G drive link where you can download all sounds individually.

I will keep collecting more sound effects and creating more videos. If this is useful for you please like my videos and subscribe to the channel ❤️
Our wiki has a bucket of resources that focus on *creative commons* music and sounds - including search engines.
I use [https://www.youtube.com/@FriendlyFreeSounds](https://www.youtube.com/@FriendlyFreeSounds) (Friendly Free Sounds). I use a youtube downloader to download it if you do not have youtube premium.
I miss the old days when you could literally find websites offering audio bits for free, now it is $16 CAD or whatever a month for most and it is a scam....really miss the old days.

We have 150,000+ free sound effects at https://www.zapsplat.com. they're all professionally recorded. Hope you find then useful."
How to rip Costco DVD to PC for editing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/vd1od3/how_to_rip_costco_dvd_to_pc_for_editing/,"Hi all,

Years ago my parents converted old VHS to Costco YesVideo DVD's. They're great and DVD still works great. I want to compile some clips for upcoming Father's Day.

Does anyone know of a tool or way to be able to take the video from DVD and put on PC? It has a Menu and options so I feel it's not as easy as it sounds, but I'm willing to do the work necessary to get this done, if it's possible.

Thanks for your time in reading!
Cheers,","handbrake
MPEG Streamclip is also great for this.

http://www.squared5.com/
These are home videos, yes? I strongly suggest using [Shutter Encoder](https://www.shutterencoder.com/). Shutter is basically ffmpeg with a user friendly interface, so you'll get a lot of power.

You can convert those VOBs to ProRes with PCM audio very easily.

Just beware of interlacing. You can either deinterlace your footage up front in Shutter (it has a number of good algorithms) or on the back end. If you're not entirely sure about what I'm talking about, deinterlace up front in Shutter.
Handbrake will convert DVDs that are not copyright-protected. Just need a computer with an optical drive.
Since this is personal media - you can totally use Shutter Encoder (or handbrake) to rip the DVD. Both free/open source tools.
Use makemkv then handbrake to turn into mp4
Were you successful in this? I’ve found that these YesVideo DVDs made even of family videos are locked. I can’t convert from VOB.
I know this is a few years old. But I just came across a few of these DVDs and I have an Apple laptop. Anyone know how to digitize these on a Mac?
I use an old free program called dvd decrypter which should do the trick
The last time I did that for a friend, as the whole video was in the same file, I just copied the corresponding .vob file to my HD then edited it in ShotCut. On Linux, I often use VobCopy, a lightweight command-line extractor which is provided with many distros, but most of the time you can directly edit .vob files.
[DVDVob2Mpeg](https://www.dvdvobtompg.com/) if you're on windows, free and lossless.

Pretty much all editing software will be able to edit MPEG-2 just fine, however DVD is typically interlaced so you may need to deinterlace in the edit or on export.

Note that some of the VOB files will be menu graphics, so you'll need to identify which ones are actually your videos first. VLC can play VOB files by themselves without having to convert them first."

Is there a way to hear the preview of those sounds?"
The people I'm editing for make me use copyright clips and images in videos even after I've told them about the possible legal trouble or how it's not ethical.,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/s8dv7q/the_people_im_editing_for_make_me_use_copyright/,"I'm a college student and ""volunteering""/interning for a really big college affiliated event as a video editor and graphic designer. This job is not paid and the work is way more than agreed upon (I know I shouldn't have taken it but it seemed good for experience and portfolio plus some friends requested, won't ever do this again). So with that I don't really care about the event outside of getting my work done.

However, for their promotional video, and even graphics, they give me the content which often includes clips and animations from random youtube channels. I ask if they have permission for these clips and they say no or that if I should at least give the channel credit by putting their name in the bottom right or somewhere and they refuse. They don't even do that in the description or comments or anywhere. I kinda feel bad for the people whose content they use and worry if I shouldn't get in trouble because of it.

I don't really know what the point of this post is outside of sharing the experience.","It sounds like yoour regretting offering your services. If you are seeking a way out of this to extract yourself from working on the project any more, this is it!

You are not being paid. There's no contract of service here. And they are asking you to produce something that is copyright infringing. You have the moral high ground to step away from this project and say ""I am sorry I cannot continue as I will not be a part of this flagrant copyright violation that is going on and to protect myself legally I am resigning from this project"". It makes them the asshole (Well...they are the asshole but you get what I mean).

If you where after something for your portfolio, you can't really use what you create for them anyway if its full of copyright infringing material that belongs to someone else.
Is this something you’ll even be able to use in your portfolio?  First, it had copyrighted content in it.  How do you represent that as part of your portfolio?  A link to the original post?  Do you cross post it to your own channel?   If so, your channel is now guilty of the same thing these folks are asking you to do. Next, these folks are willing to take advantage of others by using their content, are they willing to take advantage of you by denying you credit?


If you’re not getting paid and there is a chance and you can’t use this as an example of your work, why are you doing this?
Put your objections in writing and get their *signed* response in writing.

When they refuse, (hopeful also in writing) that's your legitimate reason to withdraw your voluntary labor.
I would tell them you won't do the work on legal and ethical  grounds.
Copyright infringement can cost them a lot of money, so keep pushing that back on them.

If all else fails, have them put in writing that they understand that they have been advised is Copyright infringement and that they are will to accept sole responsibility in the event of legal issues.

That tends to give people pause when they have to put themselves on the line
Just do your work, and than you can email anonymously the channels they steal from.
This happened to me too. I just went with it. There's nothing wrong with using software to mess with copyrighted clips. There is the area where you then receive money or such for that, but if that's what they asked then I'd just play dumb and pretend I never knew it was copyrighted. It's not like an editor can realistically go through every frame looking for copyrighted material. 

I'm not sure how the law sits on who would be responsible, but morally I think you're sound."

I'm creating a Youtube channel... Any advice on Adobe Premiere Pro?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/kzi190/im_creating_a_youtube_channel_any_advice_on_adobe/,"Hello fellow people of Reddit! I am looking into entering into a partnership with a friend to create Youtube content; Hunting, fishing, automotive, repair, performance cars... My friend has a perfect personality and mindset paired with great knowledge of all aforementioned content to do this. I on the other hand don't have the same energy and charisma he does, but my role in this is to be the person in the background editing videos and handling all the media applications, and to have a say in what direction we go in time and what people want to see in terms of content. We have an agreement to be transparent and upfront. We also want to start by doing at least one video of quality content a week. We understand the necessity of hustling content.

&#x200B;

I have a good idea of how technology works and I have a knack for figuring out and fixing almost any device I get my hands on. I build computers and fix them too when ever I find someone with work needed to be done on the off hours of my full-time job. (I don't advertise this because I am extremely time limited so it's too big of a commitment). I have a little bit of experience of videography and editing. I have a deep interest in phycology and have always enjoyed advertising.

&#x200B;

I know I am the right person to figure this out. I just need help with learning.

&#x200B;

I will appreciate any piece of advice directly related to my question or about anything else. So far, I have done some research to find the best video editing software and I came up pretty much hands down with Adobe Premiere Pro. I downloaded Adobe Premiere Pro.

&#x200B;

***To my question...*** I have watched a handful of Youtube videos about how to edit on this program and it's hard to find someone that edits with the same intention as me. I can find endless hours of professional editors that edit at a professional level as a career doing commercials but I'm far from that level. Without going to college to learn to edit, is there anyone that anyone knows who has a multiple video tutorial on every single step of editing for beginners, and intermediate? 

PS: I want to use Adobe Premiere for editing and After Effects for text/graphics. 

Also, I see there are a bunch of free audio copyright free websites out there, some better than others. Any suggestions for a good website for music and sound effects?

&#x200B;

Thanks so much for your invested time peoplekinds!","Thanks for you guy's input, I don't want anyone to get in trouble. I do appreciate the input on different applications and the differences. It is worthy of a debate it seems and I can respect that. It seems as though each program has it's advantages and disadvantages. 

I'm open to any input about this subject. It was hard to even find a thread that was ""general"" enough to post this question. I figured it fell more in the video editing area so here I am. (: 

To put my situation in to an analogy... I'm a customer who freshly walked onto your guy's used car lot looking for directions on how to get across the country while entertaining the idea of buying a new car as well for the task at hand. You guys have the job of selling me a car and giving me the lengthy directions, and you're doing great.
Just for your information, there is a program called Davinci Resolve. It’s an editing software similar to Premiere except it has a free version with pretty much everything you need unless you’re a pro. It has an After Effects equivalent built in called Fusion. 
  
If you would rather use Premiere, just do that, but Resolve is really good and just gets more and more popular. 
  
I’m still a beginner/amateur so I can’t give expert advice. I just wanted you to know of a great free alternative.
Post some YouTube links of the style of editing you’re looking to accomplish. In my opinion, if you’re not proficient in editing, you’re going to struggle in after effects. It’s a whole different beast."
Finding the right BGM?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/xxunyu/finding_the_right_bgm/,"Hey guys. I started learning editing recently. I’ve been having troubles finding the right songs or bgms for the clips I’m making.

Thanks a lot.","I also need help on the same, how we can pick the right music in least time on youtube itself- Youtube Audio Library, or royalty free channels like Audio Library for Creators, Vlog music etc… I want to have bgm music for Tech shorts, Tech tutorials and reviews like that

Have you ever had issues with BGMs and SFX?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/vba9yl/have_you_ever_had_issues_with_bgms_and_sfx/,"Hi all, 

I'm an AI engineer, mainly working on sound synthesis. I was wondering how AI can improve your video editing experiences.   


A few months ago, I was supposed to do video editing for my team project. I was new to editing, and I found it difficult to find sound effects and BGMs for my video (e.g., copyright issues, lengths, etc.)   


Have you ever had issues with BGMs and SFX like me? I'd love to hear how you guys find and manage BGMs and sound effects for your videos. And if there's a challenge, what would be the most important challenge that you like someone else to solve?   


Any feedback would be appreciated! Thanks","Not really. I have a collection of over 50000 sfx files that were either legally free or that I have purchased.

Many full time or part time editors also normally have a subscription to a stock site and most include music beds and sfx along with photos and videos and ...

Here are a few links to get you started with LEGAL free sfx.

I bought quite a bit on Bundles on Humble ... Bundle and Fanatical.

I've also made my own.
To continue from my first reply the only real issue is Digital Assett Managment. I used to use ADSR Sample Manager by ADSR Sounds but the database would often get corrupted ... other than that is was really great. Then I tried COSMOS by Waves Audio but it was to minimilistic in it's features (mostly in terns of search). Now I migrated to Explorer by Sound Particles

Links: 

ADSR: [https://www.adsrsounds.com/product/software/adsr-sample-manager/](https://www.adsrsounds.com/product/software/adsr-sample-manager/)

COSMOS: [https://www.waves.com/plugins/cosmos-sample-finder#introducing-cosmos-sample-finder](https://www.waves.com/plugins/cosmos-sample-finder#introducing-cosmos-sample-finder)

Explorer: [https://soundparticles.com/products/explorer](https://soundparticles.com/products/explorer)

Explorer is pretty great but two things I would change.

With ADSR I could drag from the search results in ADSR into other programs like my NLE or my DAW. Explorer has an export to or send to that doesn;t work the same at all.

And ALL of these programs need a ""license"" field so we can track the type of license for each assett. Right now, I keep a copy of the license with the files (grouped into folders) and when I use one I have to right click, find in folder and look up the loicense (unless it;s one of the folders I know the license to by heart) to make sure it;s not a Creative Commons License.

I've actually moved all my CC licensed sounds out to their own database to prevent using a sound incorrectly."

Editing Game Audio and Vocals,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/l3wgib/editing_game_audio_and_vocals/,"Hey everyone, so for some of my videos I record gameplay and then record my audio and layer it over the video later but I'm curious if anyone knows the best way to do ""evening out"" of the sound I guess is the best way I would put it. My game audio always comes out very loud and I wind up having to lower it so much just to get my own voice to be higher than it to the point where the game is almost mute. I hope this is a good sub to be asking this question, I wasn't sure where to post. 

I know audio is very important and I just want to make sure that I'm doing it in an effective and efficient way. I saw someone say use normalization to increase the volume for my vocal track which I tried once and it seems okay but is that the best way to do it? I'm still relatively new to all this editing business. I use Movie Studio for editing and use Audacity for recording my voice if it helps at all.

Edit: I found out why my own voice track was so low, I had to change a setting on audacity. So that part is solved I suppose. I still am curious if there's anything else I need to do besides just lowering the db of the game's audio track.","My best advice is to youtube specific tutorials about the program and effect/method/action you want to learn
Have a read into doing audio ducking. It's a process that reduces the volume of a target track based on how loud another track is, so you can set it up to reduce the game audio whenever you're talking.

[Audacity has a ducking feature built-in.](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/auto_duck.html)
My advice would be to compress the game audio, or like others mentioned, ducking the audio tracks whenever it's necessary.
 I don't know how much this will help you but this tool solved my all video/audio editing and creation issues and within 3 mins my video is ready. I am sharing a link maybe this helps you or others: [http://www.unbaisedopinion.com/14325/1](http://www.unbaisedopinion.com/14325/1)"
I need to make a trailer for a book.,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/mhowhj/i_need_to_make_a_trailer_for_a_book/,"So I am in a team with some friends and we need to make a trailer to a book for some contest. And I will use Hitfilm Express to edit the shots.   
Now the question is: How I edit the music? I never ever edited sound in my life before (apart from adding/removing music) and I know in trailers sound is very important. Also, do I use copyright free music right? And if so, where can I get some? Also, other sound effects?(like an explosion, birds, etc.)  


If you have any other advice related to trailer making please write below, I am a big newb. Thanks!","Freesounds.org is always a good place to start for free sound effects and songs.

I’m not familiar with hitfilm but my go-to advice is to look at davinci resolve. It’s free and has an amazing NLE and sound editor, and is pretty much the only color correcting software worth using. Fair light (included inside the software) is the sound editing part of resolve and is apparently really good for sound mixing a trailer, although I’ve never personally done that before. If you have time to learn it it’ll be well worth your time.
I would NOT use [freesounds.org](https://freesounds.org).

Anyone can upload there but there is no guarantee that the people uploading to it have the rights to share the sound files and the contest probably has wording stating that you have to have the right to use all media used.

Some proper sound companies offer very decent free libraries:

Sonniss, a seller of music sfx, audio tools, audio plug ins ... has a huge yearly pack they release  for free for GDC (Game Developers Conference). They have packs from 2015 to 2020 available here: [https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc](https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc)

ZapSplat is another good source for SFX: [https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-categories/](https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-categories/)

Adobe also released a TON of SFX but double check the liscence.

For audio editing, you could use Audacity (Free) but I personally prefer Reaper (60$ but with a generous full trial version).

Audacity: [https://www.audacityteam.org/](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

The nice thing with Reaper is you can even load your VIDEO file into it."
Why is it sooooo dificult to find a small meme video of someone screaming scared?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/gieomo/why_is_it_sooooo_dificult_to_find_a_small_meme/,I'm making a short stupid video while learning to edit videos and I'm having a real hard time finding a video with sound where someone screams scared. I could find gifs without sound ofc but not with sound. Does anyone know why this happens? Maybe it has something to do with copyright or loud sound? I have no idea,"Main problem is memes don't need audio, and that's why .gif file format is so popular. You need to actually think of memorable screams from popular movies or shows, and then clip or screen record them. Best solution for you is to download scenes that are on Youtube."
Davinci resolve Audio export problems,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/hi07wx/davinci_resolve_audio_export_problems/,"I'm trying to post a drum video on Instagram and Facebook that I have edited with Resolve. When I open the file on my desktop and even preview the upload on the social media platform there is audio, however once it's uploaded on either platform there is none.

This is not a copyright issue as the sound is original. Has anyone else had a similar experience? I'm tearing my hair out.

Any help would be appreciated!","Try to change the format to mp4.
Export as a DNxHR + Audio - and just see if it plays outside of Resolve.

You could have screwed up the audio outputs."

In a method to garner exposure, I would like to have a video created with sports highlights with a single of ours synced up in the background.

-pat","People post on this subreddit very often, asking for Video Editing on the cheap.

I'll tell you the same thing people on this subreddit explain to them on a constant, everyday basis.

Video Editing takes time. If you were to provide all of the source clips, give me precise timings on where to use each clip, and conform each one to the same codec? Sure, I'll do it for 100$.

But the thing is, clients don't do that. Video Editing is expensive -- that's a fact. But it's a necessary expense.

My software costs me 20$ a month. My computer cost me 1,500$. My schooling and training is costing me far, far more.

3-4 Minutes, cut to the music, and looking good? That's about 5 hours of work. My rates (strictly amateur) start at 35$/ho. A real video editor will charge you 100$/ho as a starter.
Are you offering $20 for someone to make you a music video? Or just tell you where you could get the clips? 

Also, you would have to look into who holds copyright for NBA/NFL video
This reminds me of Grandpa offering me $0.25 to mow his ten acre field of grass with an engine-less push lawn mower.
This guy has to be a troll for sure. 20 dollars for time and effort!? Plus the opportunity for more work in the future!!! 

As someone who makes music videos for bands that regularly appear on Tv music channels, this post and the replies have got me in tears of laughter. 
I'm looking for someone who does things like this for YouTube. A simple 3-4 minute video with random sports clips but edited to a point of uniformity. If you're not into the NBA, NFL, whatever then this probably isn't for you. 20 bucks for someone who does this regularly to take about an hour of their time isn't a tall task. Anyone who can help, It's much appreciated.




.....no, I'm not going to give someone 20 bucks to ""tell me"" where to find clips....(???)
I've made videos using ""windows movie editor"" from personal videos and it did NOT take me 2+ hours. I don't need some amateur who thinks they do video editing for a living because they never went to school. Just some sports clips with a song in the background. It's not rocket science. "
Editing tricks & Music/Sound Effects for Youtube videos,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/aw5e5r/editing_tricks_musicsound_effects_for_youtube/,"Hi everyone !   


I own a small youtube channel, my videos are mostly montages with commentary (I don't film myslef).  
The videos consists of basically a blurred background with pictures going in and out of frame, fadin in and out ... etc (hope I'm making sense).  
I think my edits are pretty nice, but they still don't feel really ""professionnal"" ... Do you guys know any guides or youtube videos that can help with this ? Some tutorials / tricks that beginner editors like myself should know ? (stuff like tmotion blur in premiere with transformation effect, really useful).  


Also, I'm looking to diversify the type of backgournd music I use in my videos. So far I pretty much only used music from a channel called Dj Squad Official (royalty free, he just asks that you credit him in description), but although the musics are very good they don't fit certain videos ...

Shamelessly C/P'd from an earlier response I gave to a similar question:

I've got one for you: cut together a song (or songs) from [Nine Inch Nail's Lights in the Sky tour](http://forum.nin.com/bb/read.php?52,378166). I know not everyone is a NIN fan, but I chose it because [this is officially sanctioned use of publicly released media](http://gigaom.com/2009/01/09/nins-newest-game-changer-hd-concert-footage-via-bittorrent/). Now, this was *several* years ago, so I don't know if the torrent is still live, but it's worth a shot, right?

Just note that some of the songs still belong to Universal, so they may illicit a takedown notice on YouTube, but if you're willing to navigate through NIN's release history it's possible to pick out a decent amount and make your own artistic work out of it. Evidence: [The Gift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Version_of_the_Truth#The_Gift).

------

Another challenge (shamelessly ripped off from a Radio Production project I did in college): make a video that tells a day in your life. Use your cell phone and just shoot a few scenes. We're not talking long, like three minutes is what I'm guessing would be about right. Don't invent a fictional piece, though. Maybe you could plan to have this day be the events of a weekend trip, or perhaps it's to reinforce the humdrum reality of working for eight hours a day. That's your choice, but the video should be grounded in reality.

------

Here's one I did in high school: cut a trailer. [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/feature_films) has a collection of feature films you could work on (perhaps groups of people could agree to each cut their own version of a trailer and compare the pieces afterwards).  Do note, though, some films on the IA *are* copyrighted, and are falsely uploaded as public domain (one example: Ed Wood's infamous [*Plan 9 from Outer Space*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Outer_Space#Release_and_title_changes)).

------

Make an oral history piece. For those who aren't familiar with [oral histories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_history) they're basically stories told by someone who was there, or alive during the time. So that could be as something as mundane and your parents telling you about what it was like growing up in a certain decade, or more historically significant, like having them recall some of their experiences during (Civil Rights Movement, Viet Nam, Nixon Impeachment, Moon Landing, Clinton Impeachment, 9/11 attack, Gulf War, whatever). You could do this by interviewing them simply with your cell phone, or use an audio recorder and show the story with photos and stock footage. It's up to you.

------

Go out and shoot something yourself! You don't need a professional camera and gear to make something fun. Anything you have on hand will do to start with. A point-and-shoot camera, or even a cell phone, is enough to get the ball rolling. Talk to your friends, come up with a story, go outside and shoot it!

------

If you want to go more high-end than just playing with a cell phone (and you're in the US), consider getting involved with your local Public Access channel. For a small fee you can become a member, which allows you to take classes and borrow professional grade equipment. It also gives you the opportunity to work with other people on their projects and have them help you with yours. It's a great place to meet like-minded people and to learn the craft. Tremendous bang for your buck.

------

The ground rules for all of these ideas, though: no excuses. Do your best to make something work, even if it's a kludge. If it doesn't work, find a way around using it. Your decision."
Can someone edit Artie Kendall videos? I have an idea,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/31cojy/can_someone_edit_artie_kendall_videos_i_have_an/,"I was just watching old videos of Brian Stack -for the people who don't know, he was a writer at Conan O'Brien's shows and he recently quit- and i love his ghost singer character Artie Kendall. I know it sounds terrible, but i love the character's women jokes.

Anyway, my idea is that, someone should bring together his songs and create a long song! It would be hillarious. Since all the songs are in the same melody i think it won't be that bad.

Would like a recommendation for my film!,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/1azkv7/would_like_a_recommendation_for_my_film/,"I wrote, directed and am now editing my senior thesis film about a high school boy who is starting to fall for his fuck buddy.

Lynn is essentially sick of Pat and bored in her marriage. After Pat starts to tell a story about them she gets up and leaves.
